//! This module exports functions to efficiently get a system ID for the computer
//! this application is running on.
//!
//! The particular properties of a system ID may vary across platforms, but at
//! least is guaranteed to be more repeatable across executions than a randomly
//! generated value, and fairly unpredictable for an attacker that does not know
//! any specifics of the computer that generated the system ID. A best effort is
//! made to make it suitable to generate a key for cryptographic primitives,
//! although it is **strongly discouraged** to use it as a key directly, because
//! its entropy is not guaranteed, and a successful crack could reveal the system
//! ID to an attacker. It should be assumed that the user is able to change the
//! system ID.

// This module was inspired by, and expands upon, the following crates:
// https://docs.rs/crate/machine-uid/0.2.0
// https://github.com/tilda/rust-hwid
