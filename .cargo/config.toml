# This file is primarily useful for specifying custom rustflags

# Reduce Linux binary sizes by using the DT_RELR format for relative
# relocations in generated ELF files, which is implemented from glibc 2.36
# onwards. musl targets don't get this because we've seen x64 musl binaries
# SIGSEGV on launch, and apparently that format may have some additional
# linker magic that's not fully supported by musl. References:

# Generate code for the x64 microarchitecture level 2 for x64 targets.
# This is broadly compatible (virtually any CPU manufactured after
# 2009 is compatible) and provides some nice speedups. CPUs that
# don't support it probably are too slow for PackSquash anyway. See:
