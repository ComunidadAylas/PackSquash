# Cargo configuration file for PackSquash.
# Reference: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html
# This file is primarily useful for specifying custom rustflags

# Target the x64 microarchitecture level 2 for supported platforms.
# This is broadly compatible (virtually any CPU manufactured after
# 2009 is compatible) and provides some nice speedups. CPUs that
# don't support it probably are too slow for PackSquash anyway. See:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels
#
# Disabling PIE codegen substantially reduces binary size (~20% on Linux x64) due to
# big relocation ELF headers, with hopefully negligible impact in security given our
# little usage of unsafe code. See:
