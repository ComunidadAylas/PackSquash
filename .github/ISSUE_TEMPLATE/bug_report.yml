        ## Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!

        Before submitting, please make sure that:
          - The problem is not related to PackSquash not being installed as described in the [installation guide](https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/PackSquash/wiki/Installation-guide).
          - If you are trying to use a pack in a Minecraft server, the pack works fine in singleplayer. If it works in singleplayer, a network or server misconfiguration may be the cause of the problem.
          - You can answer any issue-related questions that may be asked in the comments in a reasonable timeframe. Issues with missing information for developers tend to be unactionable, eventually closed, and a waste of time for everyone involved!
          - The report follows the guidelines for issues described in the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/PackSquash/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-issues).

        After your report is submitted, a repository maintainer will try to resolve it or get back to you as soon as possible.
