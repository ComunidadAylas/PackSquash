        ## Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!

        Before submitting, please make sure that:
          - The topic does **not** involve a security vulnerability or a method to bypass the pack protection feature. The process for reporting such matters is covered under our [security policy](https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/PackSquash/security/policy), and it **never** involves initial disclosure on a public GitHub issue.
          - The problem is not related to PackSquash not being installed as described in the [installation guide](https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/PackSquash/wiki/Installation-guide).
          - If you are trying to use a pack in a Minecraft server, the pack works fine in singleplayer. If it works in singleplayer, a network or server misconfiguration may be the cause of the problem.
          - You can answer any issue-related questions that may be asked in the comments in a reasonable timeframe. Issues with missing information for developers tend to be unactionable, eventually closed, and a waste of time for everyone involved!
          - The report follows the guidelines for issues described in the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/PackSquash/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-issues).

        After your report is submitted, a repository maintainer will try to resolve it or get back to you as soon as possible.

        1. I downloaded PackSquash from '...'

        3. I ran PackSquash with the attached options file on a pack containing files A and B
        4. PackSquash showed error X/Minecraft showed error Y on the console when trying to open the pack

        It looks like PackSquash does not support feature X introduced in Minecraft A.B.C.
        Adding support for that feature would resolve the issue

        If applicable, attach files that help reproduce the problem.
        PackSquash options files and small example packs that demonstrate the issue are
        especially helpful for a wide range of problems.
